# Facial-Expression-Detector-Through-Live-Video Using-Python
The Facial Expression Detector project aims to develop a real-time application that captures live video from a webcam, detects facial expressions, 
and classifies them into various emotion categories.

Utilizing Python's powerful libraries such as OpenCV and Deepface, the application will provide an interactive experience by displaying the detected emotions 

<b><h2>Objectives</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>To create a user-friendly application that can recognize and classify facial expressions in real-time.</li>
<li>To leverage deep learning techniques for accurate emotion detection.</li>
<li>To demonstrate the capabilities of computer vision in interpreting human emotions through facial cues.directly on the video feed.</li>
</ul>
